# Machine Learning for Background Prediction in Neutron Scattering simulations
This repository hosts the data processing and machine learning code for background prediction in neutron scattering simulations. Developed for my M.Sc. thesis at Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen

This animation shows neutron scattering events as the beam with $\lambda$=4 Ã… reaches the sample environment.
